The programming language Mini was designed and implemented by
Fridtjof Siebert (see http://www.fridi.de/ for more). Mini was
a case study for an introduction to compiler design, published
in a special issue of a German computer magazine back in 1992.

The original implementation was for the Commodore Amiga; it
was written in Oberon and generated code for the Motorola 68K.
I recently found Fridtjof's original sources and remembered
reading his article all those years ago. So as a "tribute" to
the olden days, I decided to reimplement the language. :-)
