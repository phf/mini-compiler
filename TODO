- the sources could use some more documentation, that's for sure
- the m68k backend needs work, well first I need a good simulator... :-/
- the LC-3 backend does not deal with large numbers correctly
  (neither does the assembler lc3as for that matter, scary)
- the 6809 backend is currently quite a hack, no large numbers either
- write other backends, e.g. 6502, Z80, x86, ...
- the PDF documentation is incomplete, needs lots of work
- not all code generators use the new buffer.py interface yet
- not all code generators maintain a constant pool yet
