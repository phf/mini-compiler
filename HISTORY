Release 0.3 - 2005/05/11

Added native code generators for Motorola PowerPC under
Mac OS X 10.3 and for Intel 80386 machines (aka IA-32)
under some Linux (whatever we have on the servers at UC
Riverside, I didn't bother to check). Code name "Fog"
for this one. ;-}

Release 0.2 - 2005/05/05

First released version. Includes code generators for LC-3
(limited to 16-bit arithmetic) and Knuth's MMIX. A number
of other code generators are in development but not ready
for release. Code name "Barf" for this one. :-/

Release 0.1 - 2005/04/22

Prerelease for my Spring 2005 compiler course at UC Riverside.
A straightforward port to Python and SPIM. Code generation is
already pretty modular. Code name "Wedding" for this one. :-)
